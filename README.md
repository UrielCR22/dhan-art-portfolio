# Uriel Art Portfolio

A simple, elegant art portfolio featuring pencil portraits, anime works, and mixed pieces. Built with HTML/CSS/JS and deployable via GitHub Pages.

## Customize
- Replace `your.email@example.com` and social handle in Contact.
- Update the hero background: `styles.css` (hero section) and `index.html` sample image.
- Add your images to:
  - `assets/portraits/portrait-*.jpg`
  - `assets/anime/anime-*.jpg`
  - `assets/mixed/mixed-*.jpg`
- Keep file names consistent with `index.html`.

## Local preview
Open `index.html` in a browser. For CORS-safe preview, use any local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server), but static images work fine by double-click.

## License
You own your artwork. The code is MIT licensed for simplicity.
